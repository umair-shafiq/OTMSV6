# ONLINE TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is My Final Year Project. Final Version
Introduction: The Online Task Management System is a web-based application designed to provide a paperless environment for office-based employees and employers. The system offers an efficient environment that helps team members manage project activities, HR tasks, invoice generation, social media posts and other work-related activities. The system aims to get rid of the hassle of managing and maintaining physical files, enabling team members to keep track of project tasks, their deadlines, track progress, and manage teams in an effective way. The system will help in tracking tasks and sub-tasks more efficiently, allowing managers to meet deadlines and targets. The system will improve the managing capabilities of tasks for in-office as well as virtual teams and also boost up team collaboration capabilities.
